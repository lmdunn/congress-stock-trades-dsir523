[This medium article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/python-how-to-automate-bank-holidays-767de0d42d44) showed how us the holidays module. [This article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-holidays-library/) helped understand how to use it. [This](https://pynative.com/python-get-the-day-of-week/) showed how to get day of week to check if saturday or sunday so we can adjust day of transaction accordingly.\n",

    "## Trades When Stocks Weren't Trading AKA Mitch McConnell Sells Something Not On the Exchange?\n",
    "Some trades are registered as happening when stocks weren't trading. Specifically Ingersoll-Rand (IR) partial_sales by Mitch McConnell 2017-02-02 and 2016-06-09. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data on IR doesn't start until May 8, 2017. [This Motley Fool article](https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/01/04/is-ingersoll-rand-a-buy-for-2016.aspxhttps://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/01/04/is-ingersoll-rand-a-buy-for-2016.aspx) makes it appear that Ingersoll-Rand was trading under the ticker TT (or perhaps that the part that wasn't spun into IR is trading as TT now).\n",
    "\n",
    "Gardner Denver went public in May 2017. In May 2020, it combined with Ingersoll-Rand's HVAC business -- together they started trading under IR. See [this article](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4350361-new-ingersoll-rand-debuts-under-challenging-circumstanceshttps://seekingalpha.com/article/4350361-new-ingersoll-rand-debuts-under-challenging-circumstances).\n",
    "\n",
    "This may be a noteworthy trade. The disclosure wasn't made until May 15, 2017 -- about the time of the appearance of IR on the stock exchange, and the time of Gardner Denver going public, but before they merged (at least, that it was announced).\n",

    "Weird.\n",
    "\n",
    "He sold it in June of 2019... we should look at this more closely. In the meantime, I'll estimate it as being from the first IR price.\n",

    "[This stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42380166) (finally) showed us how to use `.loc()` to create a new column without getting a copy warning. (in this case filled with a default value). It still seems to throw a warning, but maybe not as many of them. Though we seem to be doing what the warning tells us to do... YEAH, ACTUALLY THIS DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO THE WARNING. Weird."
