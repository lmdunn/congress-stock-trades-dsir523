    "We pickled the file for efficiency. That way one can reopen the pickled file and not need to run the function again, which is time consuming (and also requires internet connectivity).  [This site](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/save-a-dictionary-to-a-file/) walked us through the steps to pickle a file. Wee used pd.to_csv() but opted to use this new approach to practice what we learned in class. The downside is the data is less available (i.e. can't be opened in Excel). The upside is we practiced this approach that can be used in other situations. We'll `.to_csv()` as well."

    "# Pulling Stock Prices, and Some Assumptions We Made\n",
    "\n",
    "## Partial Sales\n",
    "We eliminated partial sales from our data set. We were able to sketch out methods for including them, but they were fairly complex because they require tracking an estimate for the total number of shares a given legislator holds of any one equity on any given day, and we didn't have time to implement it before our deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transaction Date = Day Market Was Closed\n",
    "Congresspeople sometimes entered transaction dates for which the market was closed. We presumed that means they entered the trade with their broker (or otherwise) on that date, and that it would be executed the next trading day. Our code advances the date from the transaction date until the first trading day is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, transactions were entered months or years before a ticker was on the stock market. Presumably, this was a clerical error of some kind. For those trades, we advanced the start date until we found the first date the stock was trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "[This site](https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#datetime.timedeltahttps://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#datetime.timedelta) showed us timedelta, which helped with advancing the dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "[This site](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-iterating-through-a-range-of-dates/) showed us the date_range method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Start and End Dates\n",
    "We matched purchases with sales that occurred after them, all of which were full sales. We identified them with the `'purchase-sale'` column. Ultimately, we eliminated the transaction with the corresponding sale. For these transactions, accounted for in the purchase, we used the first trading day after the purchase transaction date as the start date and the first trading day after the sale transaction date as the end date.\n",
    "\n",
    "(**Note:** In full disclosure, this is one place where we didn't have time to sanity check the results as much as we would have liked. We also didn't have a chance to write could that would check if any congresspeople went in and out of the same stock and make sure that was accounted for with multiple remaining transactions.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For sales unassociated with a purchase, we treated the first day of our analysis, 2014-01-02, or the first day the stock was traded after 2014-01-02 as the start date. We used a variable `'start_date'` near the beginning of our code set to find the first date in the `'reps'` data brought in at the beginning of this notebook. This variable is overwritten several times, but makes the code adaptable to new datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "For purchases unassociated with a sale, we treated the last day of our analysis, a variable 'the_final_date' set to 2022-07-15, as the end date.\n",
    "\n",
    "(**Note:** Some stocks stopped trading before our end date. With more time we could have written code to account for that. As we ran out of time, we had to eliminate these transactions as they created errors later in our analysis. This appears to be 247 transactions getting lost, a relatively small number.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## `'the_final_date'`\n",
    "In order to make our code more versatile, we established a variable, `'the_final_date'`, to allow easy adaptation if someone would like to run an analysis on newer data. It was manually set to 2022-07-15 based on the date the disclosure data was pulled.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Start and End Prices\n",
    "These are the prices associated with the start and end dates for each transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shares\n",
    "Number of shares is estimated from the `'amount'` and either the start or end price, based on whether the transaction was a purchase or a sale respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Start and End Values\n",
    "For a purchase, the start value is equal to the amount. The end value was estimated by multiplying the number of shares by the end price.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a sale, the end value is equal to the amount. The start value was estimated by multiplying the number of shares by the start price."
